Dungeon
=======

Framework for a dungeon game.

This project contains classes which can be used to put together a dungeon game. An example of how to use the objects can be seen in Game.java. The Game.java was designed so that any person can write a simple text file describing a dungeon game and run it using the Game code. This particular class still needs a bit of work.
